Alright, Iâ€™ve locked them out for a while! #speaker:Arlo #audio:arlo #portrait:arlo_uneasy

    * [Kill monster]
        [You kill the monster with the harpoon gun from earlier] #speaker:none #portrait:none
        There. That'll stop it from chasing us. #speaker:Endo #audio:endo #portrait:endo_emotionless
        You - #speaker:Arlo #audio:arlo #portrait:arlo_uneasy
        Hey! That was a person too! We could have saved them!
        We need to focus on saving everyone else first. There has to be more of them in the building.#speaker:Endo #audio:endo #portrait:endo_emotionless 
        Lets go back to the lab.
